# This will create/tag a new release locally, but not push anything.
# The workflow for a new release is:
#
# 1. $ make new-release JP_VERSION=1.0.0
# < you'll get prompted for a few things >
#

# 2. $ git push origin master --tags
#
#
# 3. Go to github and create a release
#    Right now, the last step isn't automated.  You still
#    have to manually upload the release assets from build/.
